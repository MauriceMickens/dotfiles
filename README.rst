dotfiles
========

Some system, editor, or other configuration file I want shared or otherwise
accessible

Usage
-----

To install these dotfiles, run::

    ./apply.sh

This will back up and apply all dotfiles and symbolically link, copy, or
otherwise apply what settings are desired. Likely used in conjunction
with an ansible script for installing ```vim tmux irssi```
